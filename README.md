# NBA Stats Automation

A fully automated Java application that tracks NBA games and generates daily analytical reports. Built with scheduled task execution, REST API integration, and intelligent rate limiting to work within free-tier API constraints.

## Project Overview

This system runs autonomously 24/7, fetching NBA game data daily, analyzing statistics, and generating comprehensive reports—all without any manual intervention. Perfect demonstration of automation principles, API consumption, and production-ready error handling.

## Key Features

- **Fully Automated**: Runs on a 24-hour schedule with zero user input required
- **Daily Reports**: Generates detailed game analysis with team statistics
- **Historical Tracking**: Maintains CSV logs for trend analysis over time
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Implements intelligent delays to respect API limits
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manages API errors, off-days, and edge cases
- **Data Persistence**: Automatically creates and organizes report files by date

## Technologies & Skills Demonstrated

### Core Technologies
- **Java 11+** - Object-oriented programming, multithreading
- **REST APIs** - HTTP requests, JSON parsing with Gson
- **ScheduledExecutorService** - Concurrent task scheduling
- **File I/O** - Report generation, CSV logging, directory management

### Software Engineering Practices
- API rate limiting and throttling
- Configuration management (properties files)
- Error handling and logging
- Modular code architecture
- Git version control
- API key security (gitignore best practices)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher
- Internet connection
- BallDontLie API key (free tier) - [Sign up here](https://app.balldontlie.io)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nba-stats-automation.git
cd nba-stats-automation
```

### 2. Configure API Key
```bash
# Copy the example config file
cp config.properties.example config.properties

# Edit config.properties and add your API key
# config.properties should contain:
# api.key=YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE
```

### 3. Compile and Run
```bash
# Compile (make sure Gson library is in your classpath)
javac -cp ".:lib/*" src/**/*.java

# Run
java -cp ".:lib/*:src" Main
```

### 4. View Reports
Reports are automatically generated in the `reports/` directory with filenames like:
- `game_report_2026-01-17.txt` - Daily game summaries
- `tracking_log.csv` - Historical data log

## Sample Output

## How It Works

### Architecture Flow

1. **Initialization** 
   - Loads API credentials from `config.properties`
   - Initializes `NbaApiClient` with rate limiting
   - Creates `AutomatedGameTracker` instance

2. **Scheduled Execution**
   - Uses `ScheduledExecutorService` to run every 24 hours
   - Immediately runs on startup, then schedules next execution

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Calls BallDontLie API for previous day's games
   - Implements 13-second delays between requests (free tier: 5 req/min)
   - Handles API errors gracefully

4. **Analysis & Reporting**
   - Processes game data to extract statistics
   - Identifies most active teams
   - Calculates game counts and participation

5. **Output Generation**
   - Creates formatted text reports in `reports/` directory
   - Updates CSV tracking log with historical data
   - Prints summary to console

### Rate Limiting Strategy

Free tier allows **5 requests per minute**. Implementation:
- 13-second delay between API calls (5 calls ≈ 65 seconds)
- Visual countdown display during waits
- Prevents rate limit errors entirely

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

- ✅ **Automation**: Building systems that run independently without user intervention
- ✅ **API Integration**: Consuming third-party REST APIs with authentication
- ✅ **Concurrency**: Using Java's scheduling and threading capabilities
- ✅ **Data Processing**: Parsing JSON, analyzing data, generating reports
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and edge case management
- ✅ **File Management**: Creating directory structures, writing formatted output
- ✅ **Security**: Protecting API keys using configuration files and .gitignore
- ✅ **Code Organization**: Clean architecture with separation of concerns

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for expansion:

- [ ] **Email Notifications**: Send daily reports via email using JavaMail API
- [ ] **Data Visualization**: Generate charts and graphs using JFreeChart
- [ ] **Database Integration**: Store historical data in SQLite/PostgreSQL
- [ ] **Web Dashboard**: Create a Spring Boot web interface for viewing reports
- [ ] **Advanced Analytics**: Calculate win/loss streaks, scoring trends, home/away splits
- [ ] **Multi-Sport Support**: Extend to MLB, NFL, NHL using similar APIs
- [ ] **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy to AWS/Azure for 24/7 operation
- [ ] **Slack/Discord Integration**: Post reports to team channels automatically

## Troubleshooting

### "API Error: Too Many Requests"
- Increase `MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL` in `NbaApiClient.java` (currently 13000ms)
- Ensure only one instance is running

### "Error loading config"
- Verify `config.properties` exists in project root
- Check that file contains: `api.key=YOUR_KEY`

### No games in reports
- API returns games from previous day
- During off-season, no games are scheduled
- Check that API key is valid

## API Reference

This project uses the [BallDontLie NBA API](https://www.balldontlie.io/)

**Endpoints Used:**
- `GET /v1/games` - Fetch game data by date range
- `GET /v1/players` - Fetch player information

**Rate Limits (Free Tier):**
- 5 requests per minute
- No authentication required beyond API key
